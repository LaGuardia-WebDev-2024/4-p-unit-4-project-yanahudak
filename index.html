  <h1>My Japan trip highlights</h1>
  
  <p>This is a list of the best memories I made on my study abroad trip in Tokyo during summer 2025.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>While we were walking to Donki, my new friend group talked and got to know each other better. I would become closer to them as the trip went on, making more memories with them.</li><br>
    
    <li>DonQuixote was extremely overstimulating, with products on display from the floor to the ceiling, music looping, different screen displays playing audio from videos, and the bright colors. </li><br>
    
    <li>Even though it felt overstimulating, I loved this store. I liked how you were able to find something new every single time you went and they had a lot of souvenirs.</li><br>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="harajuku">Shopping in Harajuku (getting caught in the rain)</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>July 15th, 2025</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It was a rainy day, for our free time we went to Harajuku to go shopping. We were supposed to meet with other friends who were already there. While we tried to find each other, my friend and I went into a shop and I purchased a cute cat plush and she bought the same cat plush but wearing a different color.</li><br>
    <li>We met up with our other frineds at Uniqlo, we shopped for some new clothes and then left. We found out our other friend went to the same store we did and she got her own cat plush.</li><br>
    <li> We then walked to Kiddyland, a multi-floor toy store with adorable character merchandise. The rain was so heavy while walking there we were all soaked since our umbrellas were flying around.</li><br>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="yanaka">Yanaka Ginza shopping on a hot summer day</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>July 20th, 2025</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Yanaka Ginza is a shopping district that is cat themed, I convinced my friends to join me since they also like cats. </li><br>

  <li>It was a really hot day, high 90s and extremely humid. After (what felt like) a long walk from the train station, we found a place that sold ice cream for 500 yen (~$3 usd) so we bought some and sat outside of the shop eating our delicious ice cream.</li><br>

  <li>After eating our ice cream, we went shopping in the different shops that were in the area. Exhausted but still in the mood for another treat, I bought a cat tail pastry with cream filling and an iced matcha. After getting one last treat, we all went back to the hostel we were staying at.</li><br>
  </ul>
